	Preparing Games for mods
	Installing The essentials. ASI loader. CLEO. Modloader etc.
	Using Modloader and covering modloader in-depth
	installing mods and understanding file types
	diagnose and solving crashesh


What is asi loaders 
	
	Asi loaders load asi plugins , these have the .asi file extension

	An ASI Loader is a proxy DLL (Dynamic Link Library) that enables game processes to 
	load custom .asi files, which are essentially plugins or scripts for adding mods 
	like new vehicles, maps, features, or performance enhancements. 

	It acts as a bridge, allowing users to inject unofficial modifications into games 
	that don't natively support them, extending gameplay and customization options. 
	
	a

What is cleo 

	we use cleo so we dont have to change main.scm file of game 
	cleo scripts = .cs
	
	cleo plugins = .cleo

	cleo allows News script in scm to be loaded separately from "main.scm"


	custom scripts and cheats,
	extending gameplay with features like spawning vehicles,
	changing game settings (time), and adding new missions or mechanics, 

			Custom Scripts: Run scripts (usually .cs files) 
			that add new features like vehicle spawning, weapons, or unique missions. 

	It works by adding new functions (opcodes) for scripting,
	 enabling powerful modifications without altering core game files.


	the 2 main additional cleo plugins are "newopcodes" and "cleo+"
	both installed is recommended 

What is modloader 
	
	Asi plugin just use to download more Asi mod 	
	makes installing mod easier 
	
	Mod Loader is an ASI Plugin for Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that adds an
	extremely user-friendly and easy way to install and
 	uninstall your modifications, without even messing around anything in your game installation.

	
	we will be installing mods inside this folder majority of mod works inside this folder 
	
	silent patch fixes most of bugs and glitch and we install it inside modloader folder 


LIMIT ADJUSTERS 
	two main limit adjusters are "open limit adjuster" and "fastman92"
	majority of limit adjuster will be fine with "open limit adjuster" 
	we dont have to mess with limit adjuster unless we told to do so


IMG factory and txd editor 
	used to edit textures in gta sa


A simple exercise about how modloader works 

	fist we will install without modloader 
		we can do it by replacing the texture one by one in img and txd files  
	
	And cuz of modloader we just have to drag and drop the files in a separate folder "modloader" 
	and it will load from modloader and work  well

.ipl and .ide 
	ide = {opject id , .dff model , txd archive , draw distance , object flags }

	
.dat 	
	general data files 
	
.ifp 
	contains animation 


.sfx and streams 

	packages similar to img archive and txd archives 


changes i made in skygfx 
	dualpass = 0
	vehiclePipe=neo
	disableGamma=0
	

open limit adjuster 
	MemoryAvailable = 1024


after completing essential mods i m now gonna explore mods which i like to add in gta sa
